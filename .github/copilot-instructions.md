## Copilot instructions for this repository

Repository state (discovered):
- Top-level folder: `BabblinGo/` (contains only a macOS `.DS_Store` file at time of inspection).
- No `README.md`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, or CI workflows were found.

If you are an automated coding agent arriving here, do not assume any hidden conventions â€” this repo is effectively empty. Follow the steps below to be immediately productive.

1) Quick discovery checklist (run these locally and record results in the PR description)

```bash
# list top-level files
ls -la

# look for common language manifests
ls **/package.json **/pyproject.toml **/requirements.txt **/go.mod 2>/dev/null || true

# show git status and branches
git status --porcelain
git branch --show-current
```

2) First actions to propose and implement
- If the goal is to start development, create a minimal README.md describing the project's purpose and a small scaffold for the chosen language (ask the user which language to use if unclear).
- If a language is detectable (e.g., `package.json` for Node, `pyproject.toml` for Python), prefer using the detected ecosystem and add a small CI job.
- For an empty repo, propose a concrete tiny first PR: add `README.md`, a `.gitignore`, and a basic `hello` program + test in the chosen language.

3) Branch / PR / commit conventions to follow here
- Create focused branches named `feature/<short-description>` or `copilot/<short>` for agent-created branches.
- Keep PRs small (1 logical change). In the PR description include the discovery checklist output.
- Use concise commit messages with a type prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` followed by a short summary.

4) Tests, CI and verification
- Add at least one fast, deterministic test runnable locally. For Node use `npm test` (with a minimal package.json); for Python use `pytest`.
- If adding CI, create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a simple matrix that runs lint and tests on push/PR.

5) Project-specific notes found in the workspace
- The only discovered entry is `BabblinGo/.DS_Store`. Do not commit OS-specific files; add a `.gitignore` that includes `.DS_Store`.

6) Style and code guidance specific to this repo
- Prefer minimal, idiomatic project layouts for the chosen language (one package/module, README, tests, simple CI). When in doubt, ask the repo owner which stack to bootstrap.
- Include a short usage example in `README.md` and a `Makefile` or `scripts/` for common commands if the project grows.

7) When merging into existing content
- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists, keep any human-written guidance and append only missing discovery steps, exact file references, or corrected commands.

8) Questions to ask the human owner (put in the PR description if unanswered)
- What language/runtime should this project use? (Node/Python/Go/Rust/etc.)
- Any preferred testing framework, CI provider settings, or coding styles/linters to apply?
- Is there an expected directory layout or prior art we should follow?

If any of the above is unclear, add a short interactive note in the PR asking the maintainer and stop before making risky assumptions.

Please review these instructions and tell me which language or initial task you'd like me to implement (README + scaffold, or initialize a particular stack). I'll update this file with any additional repository-specific patterns after you confirm or after I discover more files.
