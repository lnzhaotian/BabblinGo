UPCOMING WORK PLAN
===================

Scope
-----
Plan covers six upcoming capabilities:
1. Course-level learning record toggle defaults.
2. Admin UI controls for the default toggle state.
3. Per-user overrides for course logging preference.
4. Alternate playback mode for audio slideshow lessons.
5. Course list indicator for newly updated lessons.
6. Integrate Dify agent APIs into the app.

Global Assumptions
------------------
- Backend: NestJS + Payload CMS (MongoDB) remain source of truth for courses/lessons.
- Frontend: Expo React Native app syncing learning sessions via AsyncStorage + manual sync API.
- Authentication context and existing course/lesson APIs stay unchanged unless noted.
- We maintain localization (en, zh) for all user-facing text.

Feature 1: Course Logging Defaults (backend groundwork)
-------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Each course stores a boolean flag `trackLearningRecordsByDefault` (name TBD) that drives default logging behavior.

Tasks
- Extend Payload CMS course collection schema with new boolean field (default true) + admin description.
- Update NestJS course DTOs, GraphQL/REST responses (if applicable) to expose the flag.
- Adjust seed data/migrations so existing courses set flag to true (preserve current behavior).
- Update frontend course fetching utilities (`lib/payload.ts`, course list loaders) to read the new field.
- Ensure caching/storage layers include the flag where courses are serialized.

Open Questions
- Should flag be localized or global? Currently assumed global boolean.
- Any reporting/analytics dependency on this default setting?

Feature 2: Admin UI Controls
----------------------------
Goal: Allow editors/admins to set the course default flag inside AdminJS.

Tasks
- Add toggle field to AdminJS course form, with contextual copy explaining purpose.
- Include flag in list/detail views for quick scanning.
- Ensure admin changes propagate to API responses (already covered by Feature 1).

Open Questions
- Should non-admin editors also manage this field? Need role-check confirmation.

Feature 3: User Overrides for Course Logging
--------------------------------------------
Goal: Users can opt in/out per course without affecting global default.

Backend Tasks
- Design new collection/table storing per-user course preferences (userId, courseId, overrideState, timestamps).
- Expose REST endpoints: fetch preferences for current user, upsert preference, remove override (revert to default).
- Consider server enforcement during learning-record sync: server should respect user override when determining whether to store uploaded records.

Frontend Tasks
- Extend session logging pipeline to consult overrides when deciding to record local sessions (manual + auto).
- Provide UI in course screen (or settings) to toggle tracking per course; show effective state (default vs override).
- Persist override states locally and sync with backend (optimistic updates + fallback).
- Update progress/history views to respect overrides (e.g., hide sessions when logging disabled? Need clarity).

Open Questions
- Exact UX location for toggle (course detail header? settings panel?).
- Behavior for existing stored sessions when user disables logging (hide future only vs purge past?).
- Offline handling when user toggles while disconnected.

Feature 4: Audio Slideshow Playback Modes
-----------------------------------------
Goal: Support two playback modes: current autoplay and new "listen & repeat" mode (play clip, pause for imitation or optional speech recognition).

Tasks
- Define module-level mode enum (`auto`, `listenRepeat`). Defaults to current autoplay.
- Backend: allow content editors to set desired mode per audio slideshow module version.
- Frontend player changes:
  * Detect mode and adjust playback behavior.
  * For listen-repeat: insert configurable delays or steps (play clip -> wait N seconds -> continue). Consider per-slide settings vs global default.
  * Provide UI affordances to restart, skip, continue.
  * If speech recognition pursued: scope spike for feasibility (platform APIs, privacy, offline fallback). Otherwise implement timed pause first.
- Update download/cache logic if timing metadata added.
- QA for both modes across locales/devices.

Open Questions
- Are delays fixed, editor-configurable, or user-configurable?
- Speech recognition requirement? If yes, decide library/platform plan.
- Interaction with background audio / system controls.

Feature 5: Course Update Indicator
----------------------------------
Goal: Display a dot or badge on course list items when lessons recently changed until user views updates.

Tasks
- Backend support: track `updatedAt` on lessons (already present). Need course-level aggregate update timestamp.
- Define criteria for "new content" (any lesson updated since user last opened course?).
- Create user-specific state storing last-seen timestamp per course (client + server for multi-device consistency).
- Frontend course list: render badge when `courseUpdatedAt > lastSeenAt`.
- Update course detail screen to mark course as seen when opened (and sync state to server).

Open Questions
- Time window vs last viewed semantics? (e.g., show dot for 7 days vs until user opens course).
- Need push notifications or only in-app indicator?

Feature 6: In-App Dify Agent Integration
----------------------------------------
Goal: Expose Dify-powered agent capabilities within the mobile app for context-aware assistance.

Tasks
- Evaluate Dify API surface: authentication, rate limits, streaming vs batch responses.
- Backend: decide whether requests proxy through our server (for auth/secrets) or go direct from client. Implement proxy endpoint if needed.
- Security: store Dify API credentials securely (server-side env/secret manager). Add request validation, usage limits, and audit logging per user.
- Frontend: design agent entry point (e.g., chat panel, contextual assistant in lessons). Implement UI to send prompts, render responses (streaming if available), and handle errors/retries.
- Context injection: determine what course/lesson/session metadata should be passed to the agent (respect privacy and consent). Implement payload shaping.
- Offline handling + fallback messaging when service unavailable.
- Analytics/telemetry: track usage volumes, user satisfaction prompts.

Open Questions
- Primary use cases (general Q&A, lesson help, translation?). Need to define to scope UI and context payloads.
- Should assistant be global or course-specific? Multi-language response requirements?
- Rate limiting per user/session to control costs.
- Do we need moderation filters before showing responses?

Cross-Cutting Considerations
-----------------------------
- Authorization: ensure new endpoints respect user roles (admins vs standard users).
- Migration strategy: data backfill for existing records when deploying.
- Telemetry/analytics: decide if toggles or mode changes require tracking.
- Testing: plan unit/integration/e2e coverage for backend and frontend changes. Update manual QA checklist.
- Documentation: update admin guides, user help copy, and release notes.

Next Steps
----------
1. Review open questions with stakeholders to finalize UX/behavior decisions.
2. Break plan into tickets grouped by feature (backend + frontend tasks paired).
3. Sequence work: start with backend schema + API for course logging defaults (Feature 1), then admin UI (Feature 2), followed by user overrides (Feature 3). Parallel spike for Feature 4 requirements, then implement once logging features stabilize. Feature 5 depends on decision about user last-seen tracking.
4. Schedule design review for UI touchpoints (course screen toggle, audio player mode selector, course list badges).
